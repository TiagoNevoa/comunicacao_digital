# RelatÃ³rio:
# The Fletcher checksum algorithm is a simple method that can detect most single-bit errors 
# and some burst errors. However, it is not foolproof and may not detect all errors. 
# It's important to note that the Fletcher checksum is not designed for error correction 
# but rather for error detection. If error correction is required, more sophisticated techniques 
# such as error-correcting codes like Reed-Solomon or Hamming codes should be considered.
